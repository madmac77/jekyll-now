This project was an analysis on billboard

PROBLEM STATEMENT:  Determining if there exists a relationship between two variables in the Billboard song dataset, /
specifically time it took the song to 'Peak' and the number of weeks the song remained on  the Top 100 Billboard chart.  

May also look at the number of weeks at its peak position and the time to peak. 

HYPOTHESIS: Null Hypothesis: No significance in the relationship between time to peak and number of weeks on charts.

IDENTIFY RISKS AND ASSUMPTIONS
1) Dataset is indicative of the entire universe.  Not a very robust data set; contains only 317 songs over a brief timeline. Assumption is that this small data set accurately represents behavioural patterns /
that would be evident in the universe of Billboard songs. 
2) Clean data.
